Lung Cancer Risk Dataset for Analysis:

1. Subtitle: Dataset containing patient health records and risk factors for lung cancer prediction

2. Description: This dataset captures patient information, various environmental and lifestyle risk
factors, and clinical symptoms associated with lung cancer risk. It includes patient demographics,
exposure to pollutants, smoking habits, medical history, and other symptoms. The dataset is
valuable for analyzing trends in lung disease risk, identifying potential risk factors, and predicting
lung cancer risk levels.

3. Dataset Features:
• PATIENT ID: Unique identifier for each patient.
• AGE: Age of the patient.
• GENDER: Gender of the patient (1 for male, 2 for female).
• AIR POLLUTION: A rating indicating the patient’s exposure to air pollution (scale from 1 to 8).
• ALCOHOL USE: A rating representing the level of alcohol consumption (scale from 1 to 8).
• DUST ALLERGY: A rating indicating the severity of dust allergies (scale from 1 to 8).
• OCCUPATIONAL HAZARDS: A rating representing the patient's exposure to occupational
hazards (scale from 1 to 8).
• GENETIC RISK: A rating indicating the patient’s genetic predisposition to lung diseases (scale
from 1 to 8).
• CHRONIC LUNG DISEASE: A rating representing the severity of the patient's chronic lung
disease (scale from 1 to 8).
• BALANCED DIET: A rating indicating the patient's adherence to a balanced diet (scale from 1
to 8).
• OBESITY: A rating representing the patient’s level of obesity (scale from 1 to 8).
• SMOKING: A rating indicating the patient's smoking habits (scale from 1 to 8).
• PASSIVE SMOKER: A rating indicating the patient’s exposure to second-hand smoke (scale
from 1 to 8).
• CHEST PAIN: A rating representing the occurrence of chest pain (scale from 1 to 8).
• COUGHING OF BLOOD: A rating indicating whether the patient has coughed up blood (scale
from 1 to 8).
• FATIGUE: A rating for the patient's level of fatigue (scale from 1 to 8).
• WEIGHT LOSS: A rating indicating the severity of weight loss (scale from 1 to 8).
• SHORTNESS OF BREATH: A rating representing the frequency of shortness of breath (scale
from 1 to 8).
• WHEEZING: A rating for how frequently the patient experiences wheezing (scale from 1 to 8).
• SWALLOWING DIFFICULTY: A rating indicating the difficulty of swallowing (scale from 1
to 8).
• CLUBBING OF FINGER NAILS: A rating representing the severity of clubbing in the patient's
finger nails (scale from 1 to 8).
• FREQUENT COLD: A rating for how often the patient suffers from colds (scale from 1 to 8).
• DRY COUGH: A rating indicating the frequency of dry cough (scale from 1 to 8).
• SNORING: A rating for how frequently the patient snores (scale from 1 to 8).
• LEVEL: The overall risk level of lung cancer (Low, Medium, or High).

4. Usage:
• Risk Pattern Analysis: Identify trends in lung cancer risk factors such as smoking, air pollution
exposure, and genetic risk.
• Predictive Modeling: Develop models to predict lung cancer risk levels based on patient
demographics, environmental exposures, and symptoms.
• Symptom Analysis: Study the most common symptoms associated with lung cancer across
different demographic groups.
• Risk Factor Efficiency: Analyze the contribution of various risk factors like smoking, pollution,
and occupational hazards in predicting lung cancer risk.
